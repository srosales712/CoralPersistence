# "Reef Site and Habitat Influence the Effectiveness of *Acropora palmata* Restoration and Its Microbiome in the Florida Keys"

This repository is a companion to the published study, which examines how reef site, habitat conditions, and coral microbiomes influence the survivorship of four genets of outplanted *Acropora palmata* in the Florida Keys.
